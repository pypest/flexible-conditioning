### flexible-conditioning approach described in White and Hemmings (in review) "Using ensemble methods for efficient conditioning to imprecise information".

The "freyberg" folder contains the nessecary script, model, and binary files needed to reproduce the Freyberg demonstation.  The versions of PEST++, pyEMU,
FloPy used in the demonstration are included in the "freyberg" folder.  A recent version of NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib are required.  

The actual result files from the demonstration have been archived here: 10.5281/zenodo.7471229

The python file "workflow.py" in the "freyberg" folder can be executed to run the demonstation.  Note this will take several hours to complete, owing to the need to run MODLFOW6 on the two parameter ensembles.
